# Web Calculator

This is a web Calculator which I built for Practicing Javascript. Its front-end is made by using simple [HTML](https://github.com/topics/html) and [CSS](https://github.com/topics/css). And Back-end logic is implemented in [Javascript](https://github.com/topics/javascript).

## Interface
